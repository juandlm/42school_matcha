###### *because, love too can be industrialized*

This project involves the creation of a dating website allowing two potential lovers to meet, from the moment they sign-up to the potential encounter. A list of potential matches is presented to the user according to different customizable filters (i.e. age, geolocation, sexual orientation and gender).

A user is able to sign up, log in, complete their profile, look up other profiles, *like* them and chat with those that *liked* back.

### Technologies used
* PHP 7.2
